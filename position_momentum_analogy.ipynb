    "## Simplified Harmonic Oscillator Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if treating **phase** or **charge** as the “position-like” variable leads to identical results, let’s consider a simplified harmonic oscillator model by ignoring the nonlinearity entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the transmon-like Hamiltonian, we ignore the nonlinear (quartic) term and focus only on the harmonic oscillator part:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H} \\approx \\frac{\\hat{Q}^2}{2C} + \\frac{\\hat{\\Phi}^2}{2L_J}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{Q}$ is the charge operator, representing the charge across the junction,\n",
    "- $C$ is the capacitance,\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\Phi}$ is the phase operator, representing the phase difference across the junction,\n",
    "- $L_J$ is the effective inductance, defined as $L_J = \\frac{\\phi_0^2}{E_J}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Hamiltonian resembles a simple harmonic oscillator with effective capacitance $C$ and inductance $L_J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case A: Phase as the \"Position-Like\" Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - Assume that $\\hat{\\Phi}$ is the \"position-like\" variable.\n",
    "   - Since $\\hat{\\Phi}$ and $\\hat{Q}$ are conjugate variables, $\\hat{Q}$ will play the role of \"momentum.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Representation in Terms of Creation and Annihilation Operators**:\n",
    "   - We represent the operators in terms of creation and annihilation operators, assuming:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\hat{\\Phi} = \\Phi_{ZPF} (\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger), \\quad \\hat{Q} = i Q_{ZPF} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{a})\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Here, $\\Phi_{ZPF} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar Z}{2}}$ and $Q_{ZPF} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2Z}}$ represent the zero-point fluctuation amplitudes of phase and charge, respectively, with $Z = \\sqrt{L_J / C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resulting Hamiltonian**:\n",
    "   - Substituting these into the Hamiltonian gives:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\hat{H} = \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left( \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - where $\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_J C}}$ is the natural frequency of the harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "   - The quantized energy levels are:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     E_n = \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case B: Charge as the \"Position-Like\" Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - Assume that $\\hat{Q}$ is the \"position-like\" variable.\n",
    "   - In this interpretation, $\\hat{\\Phi}$ will play the role of \"momentum.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Representation in Terms of Creation and Annihilation Operators**:\n",
    "   - We write:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\hat{Q} = Q_{ZPF} (\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger), \\quad \\hat{\\Phi} = i \\Phi_{ZPF} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{a})\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "   - with $\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_J C}}$ as before.\n",
    "   - The quantized energy levels are:\n",

    "### Conclusion: Identical Results in Both Views\n",
    "\n",
    "In this purely harmonic case, whether we treat **phase** $\\hat{\\Phi}$ or **charge** $\\hat{Q}$ as the \"position-like\" variable, we obtain the **same Hamiltonian and identical quantized energy levels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_n = \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that in a purely quadratic (harmonic) system, the choice of \"position-like\" variable is arbitrary, as long as we treat the conjugate variable as \"momentum.\" The harmonic oscillator’s symmetric structure ensures identical results under either interpretation.\n"
