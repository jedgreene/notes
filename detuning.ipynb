    "# Mass-Spring System with Detuning in the Rotating Frame\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s work through the mass-spring system example with a driving force at a frequency close to the system's natural frequency. We’ll incorporate detuning and transform to the rotating frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Setup: Mass-Spring System with Detuning\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a mass $m$ on a spring with:\n",
    "- A natural frequency $\\omega$,\n",
    "- An external driving force oscillating at frequency $\\omega_d$, which may differ slightly from $\\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detuning $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta = \\omega - \\omega_d.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian of the system in the lab frame is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 + F_0 x \\cos(\\omega_d t),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\frac{p^2}{2m}$ is the kinetic energy,\n",
    "- $\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$ is the potential energy of the spring,\n",
    "- $F_0 x \\cos(\\omega_d t)$ is the driving term, with $F_0$ being the driving force amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Moving to the Rotating Frame\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the system in a rotating frame oscillating at the drive frequency $\\omega_d$, we express the position $x$ in terms of a new, slowly varying variable $X$ in the rotating frame:\n",

    "### Step 2: Substitute $x = X \\cos(\\omega_d t)$ into the Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "We substitute $x = X \\cos(\\omega_d t)$ into each term of the Hamiltonian.\n",

    "### Step 3: Introducing the Detuning Term\n",

    "1. From the kinetic energy term, we have $\\frac{1}{4} m X^2 \\omega_d^2$.\n",
    "2. From the potential energy term, we have $\\frac{1}{4} m X^2 \\omega^2$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "For small detuning (where $\\Delta$ is much smaller than $\\omega_d$), we can neglect the $\\Delta^2$ term, giving:\n",
