    "# Equivalence of First and Second Quantization (Exact Two-Level Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a **concrete, fully worked-out example** of a single two-level system—one ground state $\\lvert g\\rangle$ and one excited state $\\lvert e\\rangle$—treated in both **first quantization** and **second quantization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will **not** use perturbation theory; instead, we will solve the system **exactly**. In the first-quantized picture, we never speak of “transitions,” we just see how the amplitudes $c_g(t)$ and $c_e(t)$ evolve. In the second-quantized picture, we often **interpret** the coupling term as “annihilating a particle in $g$ and creating it in $e$” (and vice versa)—that is the so-called “transition” language. At the end of the day, **both** descriptions give the **same equations** and **same solutions**, illustrating explicitly that the “transition” view is just a different notation for the same underlying physics.\n",
