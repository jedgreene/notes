    "# Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a qubit coupled to a resonator, the exchange of virtual photons leads to state-dependent energy shifts in the system. This setup falls within the domain of **circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED)**, which serves as a bridge between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (QFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "While QFT deals with relativistic quantum fields and encompasses the creation and annihilation of particles in continuous, infinite-dimensional spaces, cQED operates within the framework of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In cQED, the electromagnetic field is confined within a cavity or resonator, and the field modes are quantized, treating them as harmonic oscillators. The qubit is modeled as a discrete two-level system, such as a transmon qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **virtual photons** in cQED arises from the interaction between the qubit and the quantized field of the resonator. These virtual photons are manifestations of the non-energy-conserving processes accounted for in second-order perturbation theory. They are not real, detectable particles but represent intermediate states that contribute to observable phenomena like state-dependent energy shifts and the Lamb shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cQED borrows language and concepts from QFT, such as virtual particles and quantized fields, it remains rooted in quantum mechanics. It focuses on discrete energy levels and finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, avoiding the complexities associated with relativistic effects and infinite degrees of freedom in QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, cQED provides a powerful framework for studying the interaction between light and matter at the quantum level within engineered systems. It allows us to explore quantum phenomena like virtual photon exchange and state-dependent energy shifts without invoking the full machinery of quantum field theory.\n"
