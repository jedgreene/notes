    "In the context of a qubit coupled to a resonator, the exchange of virtual photons leads to state-dependent energy shifts in the system. This setup falls within the domain of **circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED)**, which serves as a bridge between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (QFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "While QFT deals with relativistic quantum fields and encompasses the creation and annihilation of particles in continuous, infinite-dimensional spaces, cQED operates within the framework of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In cQED, the electromagnetic field is confined within a cavity or resonator, and the field modes are quantized, treating them as harmonic oscillators. The qubit is modeled as a discrete two-level system, such as a transmon qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **virtual photons** in cQED arises from the interaction between the qubit and the quantized field of the resonator. These virtual photons are manifestations of the non-energy-conserving processes accounted for in second-order perturbation theory. They are not real, detectable particles but represent intermediate states that contribute to observable phenomena like state-dependent energy shifts and the Lamb shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cQED borrows language and concepts from QFT, such as virtual particles and quantized fields, it remains rooted in quantum mechanics. It focuses on discrete energy levels and finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, avoiding the complexities associated with relativistic effects and infinite degrees of freedom in QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, cQED provides a powerful framework for studying the interaction between light and matter at the quantum level within engineered systems. It allows us to explore quantum phenomena like virtual photon exchange and state-dependent energy shifts without invoking the full machinery of quantum field theory.\n"

    "# State-Dependent Energy Shifts in a Transmon Qubit Coupled to a Resonator\n",
    "\n",
    "When a transmon qubit is coupled to a resonator, **virtual photon interactions** cause shifts in the energy levels that depend on the state of the qubit. These shifts arise from virtual transitions between the qubit and the resonator, where energy is momentarily exchanged but not permanently transferred. To analyze these state-dependent energy shifts, we use second-order perturbation theory, which accounts for the impact of these virtual transitions on the energy levels.\n",

    "The energy shifts due to virtual photon coupling between a transmon qubit and a resonator are inherently **state-dependent**. This state dependence can be understood using second-order perturbation theory, which quantifies how virtual transitions impact the energy levels of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Virtual Transitions and Energy Shifts**: When a qubit in its ground state $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ virtually absorbs a photon, it temporarily occupies a higher-energy virtual state $\\lvert 1, n - 1 \\rangle$. Although this state is not real and does not conserve energy, it contributes to an effective lowering of the energy of the original state $\\lvert 0, n \\rangle$. This is reflected in the **negative energy shift**, indicating that the interaction stabilizes the ground state.\n",
    "- **Interpretation of Signs**: A **negative energy shift** for the ground state implies stabilization; the virtual photon exchange effectively \"pulls down\" the energy of the $\\lvert 0, n \\rangle$ state, making it energetically more favorable. Conversely, when the qubit is in the excited state $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ and virtually emits a photon, the energy shift is **positive**, indicating that the interaction destabilizes this state slightly by increasing its energy.\n",
    "- **Dependence on Detuning**: The magnitude and sign of the energy shifts are closely tied to the detuning $\\Delta = \\omega_q - \\omega_r$. The behavior of these shifts shows how the energy difference between the qubit and resonator frequencies mediates the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of their coupling.\n",

    "  $$\n",
